dear all,

i would like to let all of you know that today is my last working day
at highends as i am moving on to other career options. as i leave
today, i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you and
also share some bitter-sweet moments.

jenny, the deal we worked on with the jensens was the best learning
experience for me. it was tough but i will never forget your hard work
and dedication and i hope i can be half of what you are. madison, you
have been a source of inspiration and joy and i thank you for
supporting me when i was new to this place. mr brown, thank you for
letting me work on the dillon project and this will remain a highlight
in my career and i am grateful that you included me in your team.

with regards and best wishes,

yours sincerely,

kathy dawson
