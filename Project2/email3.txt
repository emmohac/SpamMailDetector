Dear all,

This email is germane to all the team members and other staff circle
associated with Marine Company. We are writing this letter to notify
you about some temporary changes in office timings.

As all of you are aware that you were supposed to arrive by 10:00 AM
and depart by 5:00 PM. But, due to some ongoing transactions in the
financial department, your timings have been shifted to 9:00 AM to
4:00 PM. A short lunch break of 15 minutes would now be provided to
you at 1:30 PM. Late cases, if any would not be accepted.  Employers
with applications regarding medical, social or causal purpose leaves
are requested to contact HR Department.

These changes in official working timings are affective from July,
23rd. We would further contact you with emails only, if there are any
kinds of changes in the scheduled timings. For any kind of queries,
you can leave a mail on marinecompany@hotmail.com.

Expecting a full cooperation from all the members of Marine.

Sincerely,

Smith Jacob
HR Head
Marine Company
