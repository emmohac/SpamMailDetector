hello all,

as it has been informed to all of us on the last meeting that we have
to start our new project from 15th december 2010 monday onwards at our
lansdowne office, therefore a party has been organized by the
management for us before we leave.

the company wants to make this celebration big so that it marks the
beginning of our new project significantly. therefore all my
colleagues whosoever is requested for a shift at lansdowne office for
this project is requested to attain the celebration at “banquet hall”
sharp at 8pm tomorrow, 10th november 2010, wednesday.

this celebration would definitely mark the beginning of this new
venture by our company. and it will also motivate us to make the
upcoming project a grand success for our company. be there at time to
have unlimited entertainment!!!
