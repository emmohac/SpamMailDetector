dear all,

on behalf of thrill company, i am glad to invite you for a luncheon 
party with all the senior employees, team members, and other staff 
members associated with the company. since according to association’s 
policies, we have five working days, therefore we have planned to set
 a lunch party for saturday, 13th january 2012. 

please mark your presence on this party. together, we would get an 
opportunity to interact with our boss, expand our contacts, learn more
about our field and of course eat some mouth watering dishes. this
luncheon would be held in a new york cafe situated at park
lane. kindly be present by 12:00 noon so that your taste buds do not
miss any of the tempting dishes being served!

i request you to confirm your presence latest by wednesday, 9th
